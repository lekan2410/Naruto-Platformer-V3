# Naruto-Platformer-Game-V3

This Project is the third part of the previous project I made for a course named "Naruto Platformer Demo".
This project is a second version of the Demo, but instead of being a platformer game, I have changed it into a 
2D fighter game as I am a big fan of fighting games and anime like Naruto.

When you start the game, there is a menu that allows you to change characters quit, and start the game.
WARNING, The game may lag more than the previous version when the game starts but eventually speeds up as the game carries on.
